By using 2 datasets - "matches" which contains all general stats of all the matches played from season 2008 to 2019 IPL edition and "deliveries" dataset contains ball-by-ball datas of all the matches played from season 2008-2019, as a data analyst, I found out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.
